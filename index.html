    <p
      >A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the
      shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape.
      The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.</p
